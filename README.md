nespresso brewbutton
The nespresso expert is a piece of shit and the app even more. What I needed was a small brew button that can brew my morning coffe the way I want it. Therefore I reverse engineered the stuff.

The brew button is based on a simple ESP32 example, where I only added a debounced PIN, and the stuff needed to program the nespresso machine.
